# Actix Website

The work in progress website for the actix project based on tokio's website.

## Getting Started

Building the website depends on [Hugo](http://gohugo.io). So, first make sure
that you have it installed. If on OS X and using Homebrew, run the following:

```sh
brew update && brew install hugo
```

Then, get the website running locally:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/mitsuhiko/actix-website
cd website
hugo server
```

Then visit [http://localhost:1313](http://localhost:1313).

# License

Pretty murky.  Right now a massive clone of the tokio website.  Will get this
figured out as we go along.
