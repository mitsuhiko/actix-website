# Getting Started

Letâ€™s write our first actix web application!

## Hello, world!

Start by creating a new binary-based Cargo project and changing into the new directory:

```bash
cargo new hello-world --bin
cd hello-world
```

Now, add actix and actix web as dependencies of your project by ensuring your Cargo.toml
contains the following:

```ini
[dependencies]
actix = "0.5"
actix-web = "0.6"
```

In order to implement a web server, we first need to create a request handler.

A request handler is a function that accepts an `HttpRequest` instance as its only parameter
and returns a type that can be converted into `HttpResponse`:

Filename: `src/main.rs`

```rust
extern crate actix_web;
use actix_web::{HttpRequest, Responder, App, server};

fn index(req: _HttpRequest) -> Responder {
    "Hello world!"
}
```

Next, create an `Application` instance and register the request handler with
the application's `resource` on a particular *HTTP method* and *path* and
after that, the application instance can be used with `HttpServer` to listen
for incoming connections. The server accepts a function that should return an
`HttpHandler` instance.  For simplicity `server::new` could be used, this
function is shortcut for `HttpServer::new`:

```rust
fn main() {
    server::new(|| {
        App::new()
            .resource("/", |r| r.f(index))
    })
       .bind("127.0.0.1:8088").unwrap()
       .run();
}
```

That's it! Now, compile and run the program with `cargo run`.
Head over to ``http://localhost:8088/`` to see the results.
