# Welcome to Actix

Actix is your door to developing web services with Rust and this documentation
is going to guide you.

This documentation will cover mostly the `actix-web` part which is the high
level web framework build on top of the `actix` actor framework and the
[Tokio](https://tokio.rs/) async IO system.
