Want to talk to others about questions?  The [actix gitter
channel](https://gitter.im/actix/actix) is your best starting point.

If you think you found a bug it's best to go to the
[github](https://github.com/actix) directly.  There are two repositories
that you might want to report against.  [actix](https://github.com/actix/actix)
for issues with the actor framework or [actix-web](https://github.com/actix/actix-web)
for the high level web framework.

We're a welcoming community so don't be afraid to engage.  Interactions
are [goverend by our code of conduct](coc/).
